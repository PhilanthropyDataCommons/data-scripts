# data-scripts

Command-line scripts to add data to a PDC service instance.

## Available scripts

Each script should have a corresponding `npm` command. To list scripts, use `npm run -l`.

## To run a script

Run a script with a `--` between the name and its arguments:

`npm run [script name] -- --[parameter name]=[arg]`

To find information on one of the scripts, look in the script itself at `src/[script name].ts`.
